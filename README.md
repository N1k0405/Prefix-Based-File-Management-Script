<h1>Prefix Based File Management Script</h1>

<p>This Python script serves as a quick sorting script to sort through Music project files. </p>

<p>In my use-case, when making music, I will save a file with the prefix "good" or "trash" to determine where it should be placed when the script is run.</p>
